<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a collection of bookmarklets for quickly identifing accessibility issues. I am constantly going through markup that I have never seen before and having to decipher what is being generated and what elements the attributes I am looking for are associated with (if there are any). So I thought why not start creating bookmarklets to check for the thigs I do on a daily basis. 
<br>
<br>
I indent this to be open source and would like feedback and inputs on what you would like to see. Or if you have built one that you think would be useful here feel free to create a pull request. I would like this to become a robust set of tools that you can use both when debugging and creating components to ensure we make them accessible for all users.
